Now that everyone is heavily investing in Docker, I guess it's time I do a bit of a deep-dive into Linux CGroups. Dealing with them every day, it's easy to just say "Oh yeah, those just do the CPU and Memory stuff for my container", but I really want to look at how this all works under the hood.

## What Are CGroups?

The kernel feature cgroups, or Control Groups, allow us to allocate various resources to processes we're running on a system.
These cgroups can be:
- CPU Time
- System Memory
- Network Bandwidth

This is particularly useful when running multiple processes on the same system. This is something Docker was built to solve.
