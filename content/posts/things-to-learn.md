Nothing to see here. I'm just using this as a checklist of things I should probably try to do with it. 
Should I probably fix up the medium migration script to be more Hugo specific? I dunno. Just throwing a bunch of ideas into this and seeing what I feel like working on during my weekends.

## ü§ì What should I probably learn?

- Find some more systems engineering things to cover
- Deep-dive into Golang
- Deep-dive into TypeScript
- WAF Tuning (bleh)

## ü§ñ What should I probably tinker with?

- Terraform for configuring more than just infra
- [Google's CDK](https://github.com/google/go-cloud)

## ‚úèÔ∏è What should I probably write about?

- Security best practices for your org
- Why Software Engineers are Important in Infra Teams
- On the importance of letting your teams focus on what they do best

## üõ† What should I probably build?

- Medium post to Hugo post converter
- Rewrite a bunch of slack bots into a ~~not shit language like python~~ language I want to learn more about.
