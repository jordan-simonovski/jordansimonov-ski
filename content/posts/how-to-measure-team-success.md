_I'm making this a live document of sorts that I'll continue to update as my understanding of the philosophy continues to evolve. Maintaining this in listicle format to make it easy to write and ingest. Dont @ me._

As someone that maintains and sets up the infrastructure that an organisation _needs_, what do I need to give a ðŸ’© about? (in no particular order)

## 1) Do You Understand the State of Everything in the Existence of Everything That You've Made?

Convoluted sub-title aside, what I'm trying to say is that we should give a ðŸ’© about knowing exactly what we're running within the ecosystem that we maintain. i.e.:
- How many servers are we running?
- Where are they running?
- How are they running?
- Who owns it?
- Is it up-to-date?
- How much does it cost?

What gives us this kind of visibility is the investment centralised observability.

## 2) How Are Things Being Deployed?

## 3) Trimming the Fat

## 4) What Are Our Feature Lead Times?

## 5) How Comfortable Are Devs with Owning Their Apps End to End?

## 6) Is Reliability a Requirement?

## 7) Do We Have the Right Security Controls in Place?

## 8) Invest in Great Tooling
