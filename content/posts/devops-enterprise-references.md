I didn’t just make a lot of this stuff up. I did some pretty extensive reading to understand what it is that other organisations do. Here are some of the books that I’d recommend:

[**The Phoenix Project **](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592)— This was the first piece of DevOps propaganda that I read. I didn’t fully understand what it was to have great IT Operations, and frankly I just wanted to do some cool cloud stuff. [Gene Kim](https://medium.com/@RealGeneKim) did a fantastic job at telling a story about an old-school organisation with outdated change processes, and how it transformed into a bastion of Continuous Delivery.

[**The DevOps Handbook**](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JE4VAD9K20X7BK1GFGD6) — This is another one by Gene Kim, but is a collaborative piece with [Patrick Debois](https://medium.com/@PatrickDeboisSTH), John Willis, and [Jez Humble](https://medium.com/@jezhumble). If you need to find out where it is that you need to start, then this is the book for you. It outlines a lot of the problems with traditional IT Operations, and makes some great recommendations on what to change.

[**Site Reliability Engineering**](https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html)— Is a great book by the Google SRE Team which really focuses and enforces the ideas of building resilient systems, and what it means to put a lot of engineering thought and design behind the systems that you run.

[**Continuous Delivery**](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912) — Is an awesome book by [Jez Humble](https://medium.com/@jezhumble) and David Farley that you see a lot of people quoting or referencing when trying to enforce the legitimacy of their claims (kind of like The Bible). Jokes aside, this is a great read!

[**Kanban Automotive Revolution (Boardgame) **](https://www.amazon.com/Stronghold-Games-2010SG-Automotive-Revolution/dp/B00OMXW2MU/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1489308824&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=kanban+the+board+game)— If you can’t get anyone at work to read a book because they’re too busy, maybe try a boardgame!
